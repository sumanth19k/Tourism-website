    info: "Nestled among the serene heights of the great Himalayas are four pilgrim-destinations namely Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath, collectively known as Char Dham. These pilgrimage centers draw the maximum numbers of pilgrims each year, thus becoming the most important hubs of religious travel in the whole of Northern India. Traditionally, the pilgrimage begins from the West and ends in the East. Thus, the Char Dham Yatra commences from Yamunotri, then proceeding to Gangotri and finally to Kedarnath and Badrinath.",

    info: "There is no exaggeration in Kerala’s status as ‘God’s own country’, for how else does one explain its gorgeous 600-kilometre stretch of undisturbed coastline skirting the Arabian Sea, the palm-fringed beaches, a network of languid backwaters home to a vibrant rural life, the misty tea-covered Western Ghats, wildlife reserves teeming with endemic flora and fauna and spice plantations running rampant on its valleys and hill slopes. One of the country’s cleanest states, and perhaps the friendliest too, it is an absolute delight travelling around, visiting the historical temples and museums in Trivandrum, getting a slice of the maritime history in Cochin (Kochi) or taking a boat ride to islands like Mattancherry to trace its Jewish roots. Add to it a culture that is defined by colourful folk art and dance forms, a cuisine that is subtle yet generous in its use of spices, and a passion for Ayurveda that promises to soothe frazzled nerves. Simply slacken your stride and let all its sights and smell envelop you.",
